xvim is a command line utility that provides a simple xargs-like wrapper around vim.

It's goal is to eliminate those pesky "Warning: input not from terminal" messages that lead to a fubar'd tty.

example:
Bad things happen to your terminal when you...
$> find . -name \*foo\* | xargs vim

However if you do this instead your tty should be safe...
$> find . -name \*foo\* | xvim
